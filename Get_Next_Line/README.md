Like we did in our last project [Born2BeRoot](https://github.com/Zanana-med/Born2BeRoot?tab=readme-ov-file), we're going into the main subject PDF, and understand all the **requirement** to pass the GetNextLine project plus the bonus of course.

**Syntax:**
```C
static Data_Type Var_Name = Var_Value;
```

**Local variable** is destroyed and lose its value when the function that contain this variable is over. The local variable stored on the **Stack** memory area.   

**Static variable** stored on the **data segment** in the memory, it has the ability to preserve its value, even if the variable out of its function scope!
